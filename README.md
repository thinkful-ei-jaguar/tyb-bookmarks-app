# Taylor Bradshaw's Bookmarks App Project

This application allows a user to keep a list of favorite websites that includes the website's name and url. In addition, the user can rate the website on a scale from 1-5 and add a description. This project uses a very mobile-friendly interface so that the user can navigate through their individual bookmarks with ease.

The following user stories were implemented in this project:


As a user:

I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

title
url link
description
rating (1-5)

I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark

Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)

I can select from a dropdown (a select element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection.
